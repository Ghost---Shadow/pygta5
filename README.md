Explorations of Using Python to play Grand Theft Auto 5.

Pull requests welcome. At the moment, we mostly need PID control. If you know how to help us there, please do!

Currently, to use the latest version of this AI, you will need to run first "create_training_data.py," then balance this data with "balance_Data.py."

When creating training data, this works when you have the game in windowed mode, 800x600 resolution, at the top left of your screen. You need this for both training and testing. Eventually we can go off the window's name, but, for now, the current code wants the window in the corner.

Do this for as many files/training samples as you wish. I suggest 100K+ after balancing, but the more the merrier.

Next, Train the model with train_model.py.

Finally, use the model in game with test_model.py.
